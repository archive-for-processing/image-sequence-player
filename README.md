## Image Sequence Player for Processing

**A Processing library to load, playback and display image sequences**

There already is a gifAnimation library that loads, plays back and exports .gif animation,
however there are cases where finer control is needed, such as:

- easily integrating image sequences into Processing sketches
- displaying animation sequences with more colours, but maintain transparency (e.g. animated png sequence with crisp colours)
- precisely controlling a timeline frame by frame where audio isn't needed (and video keyframes don't offer enough control)  

Contributions welcome.

## Credits

The library is heavily influenced by [Patrick Meister's gifAnimation library](https://github.com/extrapixel/gif-animation)

The examples include [James Patterson's animation](http://presstube.com/hello/) from Processing > Examples > Topics > Animation > AnimatedSprite

The libray has been developed at [Hirsch & Mann](http://hirschandmann.com/work) and used on multiple projects
